# agririsktestcode
Repo for sample code that is being developed for open source fundamental crop risk assessment in python, incorporating different key datasets. Intended to be broadly useable and understandable across a range of stakeholders.

Currently usng this as a models systematic review (structuring different models to see what might work best for climate physical risk use). Main comparison is between FOWOT and DSSAT, both very different models with the former far simpler to implement, but lacking in some variable detail.
